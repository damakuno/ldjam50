MC Today’s not a good day. I know what’s coming but still...
MC And yet here I am again. Being here just brings back so many memories.
MC You came back here once after we moved back right?
MC What was it you said you did?
MC Oh that’s right.
MC You went to check on that carving you left on the big tree.
MC You were so happy that it was still there
MC ...and right now so am I.
MC At least it’s something I can remember you by.
