MC Perfect day for a stroll in the park. Not too many people around either.
MC You’d have loved a day in the park like this, just taking a stroll.
MC You did something like that before we left right?
MC What was it that happened?
MC You couldn’t leave without seeing this place one last time.
MC You did something too...what was it again?
MC You told me you went out with a bang or something.
MC Is that right?
MC Could you tell me if I’m right sis?
MC Hey where’d you go?
MC ...oh right.
