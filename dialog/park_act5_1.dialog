MC Park’s quiet today. I’ve got it almost completely to myself.
MC Hmm...reminds me of that time I snuck in here after dark.
MC What was it that happened?
MC I got mad and stormed off. Somehow managed to make my way here.
MC Then I spent a good long time in that tree just thinking and enjoying the quiet.
MC It was peaceful...until dad showed up and dragged me back.
MC Thinking back, I think I can understand why he was so upset.
MC He was afraid of losing me
MC ...just like how I am of losing you too.
