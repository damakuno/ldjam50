MC Park's quiet today. I've got it almost completely to myself.
MC Hmm...reminds me of that time I snuck in here after dark.
MC What was it that happened?
MC I was looking to run away to somewhere I could be me.
MC It was good while it lasted. The quiet helped. This place could be whatever I wanted.
MC Then dad came and ruined all the fun.
MC Looking back, maybe he had a point
MC ...but he was still too harsh about it.
MC What do you think sis?
