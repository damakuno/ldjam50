MC Oh, they’re trimming the grass today.
MC Ah, the smell of freshly cut grass takes me back.
MC What was it that usually happened?
MC We’d play and pretend we were in another world.
MC This place was our forest, our swamp, our wonderland.
MC We’d throw pieces of cut grass at each other like they were toys.
MC Mom and dad were always mad about how much grass they’d have to clean off of us later.
MC (Chuckles)
MC Still, I wish we could go back to that world we made. 
MC You, me, even mom and dad. That world was perfect.
