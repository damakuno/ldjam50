MC I remember when we used to run around here all the time.
MC What was it that usually happened?
MC I'd pretend I was a pirate and you'd try to fight me.
MC We'd “fight” until we both fell into the pond over there...
MC Then mom and dad would be screaming at us while they pulled us out.
MC Ah...I wish we could go back to those days.
